## üßÆ Prediction Algorithms

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network designed for time series prediction.

**How it works:**
- Analyzes historical price patterns and trends
- Learns temporal dependencies in stock data
- Generates predictions with confidence intervals
- Confidence decreases for longer forecast periods

**Key Features:**
- Upper and lower bound predictions
- Adaptive confidence scoring
- Trend analysis
- Volatility consideration

### Monte Carlo Simulation
A probabilistic technique that runs multiple random simulations to model uncertainty.

**Implementation:**
- Executes 100 independent price scenarios
- Each scenario uses randomized daily returns
- Shows distribution of possible outcomes
- Helps visualize risk and potential ranges

**Benefits:**
- Understand prediction uncertainty
- See best and worst case scenarios
- Risk assessment
- Portfolio planning support

## üìê Metrics Explained

| Metric | Description | Usage |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Current Price** | Latest closing price from your dataset | Baseline for predictions |
| **Predicted Price** | LSTM forecast after N days | Target price expectation |
| **Expected Change** | Percentage change from current price | Quick gain/loss assessment |
| **Volatility** | Standard deviation of price movements | Risk measurement |
| **Confidence** | Prediction reliability (60-95%) | Decreases with forecast length |
| **Upper/Lower Bounds** | Price range boundaries | Risk tolerance planning |

---

## üíº Trading Recommendations

The platform generates automated signals based on predicted price changes:

| Signal | Criteria | Interpretation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| üü¢ **BUY** | Predicted increase > 3% | Strong upward trend expected |
| üü° **HOLD** | Predicted change -3% to +3% | Stable, wait for clearer signals |
| üî¥ **WAIT** | Predicted decrease > 3% | Potential downward movement |
